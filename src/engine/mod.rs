//! Detection engine.
//!
//! In Week 1 of the rules-as-data refactor (Path B), this module hosts a closed
//! `Matcher` enum and a `CompiledRuleSet` shape that mirrors the hardcoded
//! detection patterns currently in `frameworks.rs`. Week 2 swaps the source
//! from compiled-in Rust to YAML on disk; the consuming API in `scanner.rs`
//! does not change.
//!
//! See `docs/rules-design/round3-synthesis.md` for the full design context.
